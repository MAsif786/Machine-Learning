# Machine-Learning
This is the collection of ML Codes that I write in Python. Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI). The goal of machine learning generally is to understand the structure of data and fit that data into models that can be understood and utilized by people.

> I am **Umair Iftikhar** and here we are going to learn **Machine Learning**.
This is a tutorial of machine learning in which you can learn machine learning from scratch. For the video tutorials in Urdu Language you can watch my [youtube](https://youtube.com/umair-iftikhar) 

This tutorial reviewed some of the use cases of machine learning, common methods and popular approaches used in the field, suitable machine learning programming languages, and also covered some things to keep in mind in terms of unconscious biases being replicated in algorithms.

I chose python and C language for ML. Python due to the increased development of deep learning frameworks available for this language recently, including TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras. C is the language of choice for machine learning and artificial intelligence in game or robot applications (including robot locomotion).

## Prerequisite
Prerequisite of the course are following:
* Basic High School Math
* Python Programming
* Git

## Software in your computer
From starting this course you need to install following software in your computer.
* [Python 3](https://python.org)
* [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/)

## Library for the Python
Pythonâ€™s popularity may be due to the increased development of deep learning frameworks available for this language recently. In our Course we are going to use following two libraries.
* TensorFlow
* Scikit-learn 

The scikit-learn machine learning library is built on top of several existing Python packages that Python developers may already be familiar with, namely NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib. 

Although machine learning is a field within computer science, it differs from traditional computational approaches. In traditional computing, algorithms are sets of explicitly programmed instructions used by computers to calculate or problem solve. Machine learning algorithms instead allow for computers to train on data inputs and use statistical analysis in order to output values that fall within a specific range. Because of this, machine learning facilitates computers in building models from sample data in order to automate decision-making processes based on data inputs.
