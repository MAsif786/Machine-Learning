# Machine-Learning
This is the collection of ML Codes that I write in Python. Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI). The goal of machine learning generally is to understand the structure of data and fit that data into models that can be understood and utilized by people.

I chose python and C language for ML. Python due to the increased development of deep learning frameworks available for this language recently, including TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras. C is the language of choice for machine learning and artificial intelligence in game or robot applications (including robot locomotion).

The scikit-learn machine learning library is built on top of several existing Python packages that Python developers may already be familiar with, namely NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib. So in start I chose scikit-learn to start learning.

Although machine learning is a field within computer science, it differs from traditional computational approaches. In traditional computing, algorithms are sets of explicitly programmed instructions used by computers to calculate or problem solve. Machine learning algorithms instead allow for computers to train on data inputs and use statistical analysis in order to output values that fall within a specific range. Because of this, machine learning facilitates computers in building models from sample data in order to automate decision-making processes based on data inputs.
